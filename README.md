# Diabetes Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the probability of an individual having diabetes, using a machine learning model built from health data provided by users.

## Overview of the Project

The aim of this project is to create a system that can predict the likelihood of diabetes based on health parameters. By entering relevant data, users receive predictions generated by the trained model.
## Key Steps in the Project

1. **Data Collection**: Relevant medical datasets were sourced to gather health-related data.
2. **Exploratory Analysis**: The dataset was examined to uncover important trends and insights.
3. **Visualization**: Key relationships within the data were visualized using graphs and charts.
4. **Data Preparation**: The collected data was cleaned and formatted for use in the machine learning model.
5. **Model Training**: A machine learning model was created using scikit-learn to predict diabetes outcomes.
6. **Model Assessment**: The model's performance was evaluated with various metrics to ensure reliability.

## Technical Details

### Machine Learning Model

- **Framework**: scikit-learn
- **Algorithms Applied**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests.
- **Input Parameters**: The following health factors are used for prediction:
    - Number of Pregnancies
    - Insulin Level
    - Age
    - Body Mass Index (BMI)
    - Blood Pressure
    - Glucose Level
    - Skin Thickness
    - Diabetes Pedigree Function
- **Output**: The prediction result determines whether the individual is likely to have diabetes (Yes/No).
